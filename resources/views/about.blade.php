                    <h3 class="sb-text"> We built a digital health platform to connect doctors and their patients</h3>
                    <p>The platform supports the goal of continuous care for health by providing healthcare providers with a Virtual Practice that enables them to be securely accessible to their patients, through web and mobile services enabling online consultations and remote patient monitoring. The Virtual Practice also supports essential practice management functions and an online presence management for better patient engagement. </p>

                    <h3 class="sb-text">Patients and Healthcare Providers Need This Because...</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Healthcare providers need to be more accessible to their patients but in a manageble way that does not disrupt their hospital hours or personal time. </li>
                        <li>Variations in health conditions go unnoticed in between hospital visits</li>
                        <li>Staying on track with one's medication and changes to diet and routine isn't easy</li>
                        <li>Patients have healthcare needs that extend way beyond a visit to the clinic or hospital. </li>
                        <li>Required healthcare expertise is not always locally available</li>
                        <li>Also the increasing numbers of patients with chronic conditions require doctors to establish efficient, convenient and responsive ways of supporting chronic patients.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="sb-text">Technology Can Help but patients need real healthcare providers</h3>
                    <p>While patients are increasing using health sensors, connecting with their doctors and other patients on social media and searching for information online, it is very important to understand that</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Its difficult and risky to interpret one's own health data without a real healthcare provider</li>
                        <li>It takes a proper understanding of a patient's personalized needs to diagnose and treat an illness</li>
                        <li> Social networks and messaging apps are not the right places to be discussing health issues</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="font-weight: 500; padding-top:10px;">And this is why the best way to meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers is enable them to securely connect and engage with each other, with proper access to health data.</p>
